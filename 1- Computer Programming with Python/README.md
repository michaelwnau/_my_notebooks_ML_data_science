### Notebooks in this repo represent concurrent work in the [AI Academy](https://ai-academy.ncsu.edu/), a joint project between NC State University and the US Department of Labor.
I am a member of Cohort 5 at the AI Academy and meet twice weekly for 50 weeks to work collaboratively on scientific programming in Python, data mining
and visualization, AI, and machine learning.
